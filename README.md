# Materials from the FMI course DSA

## Agenda:
* [Algorithms](./algorithms) folder - search/sort algorithms, algorithms in graph.
* [Data Structures](./Data%20Structures) folder - BST, Linked List(singly), Graph data structures with the most common functions for them.
* [Exam 2023](./Exam%202023) folder - tasks & solutions to the FMI DSA exam 2023 winter session.

> Remark 1: all materails are written in C++. 

> Remark 2: materials were created in order to succeed in DSA exam 2023 summer session. Algorithms and structures had to supply FMI DSA course expectations, not in the global meaning.
