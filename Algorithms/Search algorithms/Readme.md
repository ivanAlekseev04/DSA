# Search algorithms:

## Binary search
* Works on sorted arrays(collections)
* Time complexity: O(log2N) (N - count of elements)
* Space complexity: O(1) for iterative, O(log2N) for recursive

## Ternary search
* Works on sorted arrays(collections)
* Time complexity: O(log3N) (N - count of elements)
* Space complexity: O(log3N) 

## Jump search
* Works on sorted arrays(collections)
* Time complexity: O(N^(1/2)) (N - count of elements)
* Space complexity: O(1)
